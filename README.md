## CentOS:
CentOS (**Community ENTerprise Operating System**) was a free, open-source Linux distribution based on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source code. It aimed to provide a stable, enterprise-class, production-ready Linux platform without the cost of a RHEL subscription.


### Key Features:
- Binary-compatible with RHEL (same packages, same stability).
- Free to use (community-supported, no license fees).
- Long-term support (each version supported for ~10 years).
- Enterprise-grade stability (suited for servers, databases, and enterprise apps).
- Large ecosystem support (databases, web servers, virtualization, cloud).


### CentOS Versions:

- **CentOS 7** : Released in 2014, supported until **June 30, 2024** (end of life).
- **CentOS 8** : Released in 2019, but shifted to **CentOS Stream in 2021**.
- **CentOS Stream** : A rolling-release distro that sits between Fedora and RHEL.
    - Acts as a **testing ground** for what will become the next minor release of RHEL.




In **December 2020**, Red Hat announced that **CentOS Linux** would be discontinued. CentOS was the **free RHEL alternative**, but now itâ€™s replaced by **CentOS Stream**. If you want RHEL-like stability for production, people now use **Rocky Linux** or **AlmaLinux**.
